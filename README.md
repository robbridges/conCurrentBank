# Go Concurrent bank

Practicing concurrency lately and wanted to make a concurrent function that accepts a struct of value and type of type of transaction, then actions on it

TODO :
[x] I am hard coding the amount of times a transaction should be processed. That just seems terrible, I need to find a better way
This needs tested in something more than a bench mark. While it's fast there's no proof that it works.
